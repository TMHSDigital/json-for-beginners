# Contributing to JSON for Beginners

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Visual & UX Conventions

- The homepage uses a prominent hero section with a gradient background, large title, and tagline for immediate context.
- Card-style panels (e.g., .contents) use border-radius, subtle shadows, and a light background for clarity and focus.
- The primary color is blue (#2563eb) with lighter blue accents; backgrounds are light gray for contrast.
- Typography uses the Inter font for a modern, readable look. Headings are bold and large for hierarchy.
- Navigation is sticky, with active/hover states for clarity.
- All visual changes should be made in `docs/css/style.css` and use CSS variables where possible.
- When adding new sections or pages, follow the established hero/card/typography patterns for consistency.
- For major visual changes, update this section and provide a before/after screenshot in your pull request.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/TMHSDigital/json-for-beginners/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/TMHSDigital/json-for-beginners/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
