# Why JSON?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has become the de facto standard for data exchange on the web. Here's why it matters:

## What is JSON?

JSON is a lightweight, text-based data interchange format that's derived from JavaScript object syntax. It's language-independent and can be used with virtually any programming language.

## Key Benefits

1. **Human-Readable**: JSON is easy to read and write for humans
2. **Language-Agnostic**: Works with any programming language
3. **Web Standard**: The preferred format for APIs and web services
4. **Simple Structure**: Based on two universal data structures:
   - Objects: Collections of key-value pairs
   - Arrays: Ordered lists of values

## Why Learn JSON?

- Essential for web development and API integration
- Used in configuration files and data storage
- Required knowledge for modern software development
- Foundation for working with NoSQL databases
